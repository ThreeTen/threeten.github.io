/**
 * A year-week in the ISO week date system such as {@code 2015-W13}
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@code YearWeek} is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination
 * of a week-based-year and week-of-week-based-year.
 * Any field that can be derived from those two fields can be obtained.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class does not store or represent a day, time or time-zone.
 * For example, the value &quot;13th week of 2007&quot; can be stored in a {@code YearWeek}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 * in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 * system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 * For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 * However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 * to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * ISO-8601 defines the week as always starting with Monday.
 * The first week is the week which contains the first Thursday of the calendar year.
 * As such, the week-based-year used in this class does not align with the calendar year.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Implementation Requirements:&lt;/h3&gt;
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class must be treated as a value type. Do not synchronize, rely on the
 * identity hash code or use the distinction between equals() and ==.

     * Calculates the amount of time until another year-week in terms of the specified unit.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This calculates the amount of time between two {@code YearWeek}
     * objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
     * The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified year-week.
     * The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
     * The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
     * {@code YearWeek} using {@link #from(TemporalAccessor)}.
     * For example, the period in years between two year-weeks can be calculated
     * using {@code startYearWeek.until(endYearWeek, YEARS)}.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
     * complete units between the two year-weeks.
     * For example, the period in years between 2012-W23 and 2032-W22
     * will only be 9 years as it is one week short of 10 years.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
     * The first is to invoke this method.
     * The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     *   // these two lines are equivalent
     *   amount = start.until(end, WEEKS);
     *   amount = WEEKS.between(start, end);
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The calculation is implemented in this method for units {@code WEEKS}
     * and {@code WEEK_BASED_YEARS}.
     * Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
     * passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
     * as the second argument.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param endExclusive  the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a {@code YearWeek}, not null
     * @param unit  the unit to measure the amount in, not null
     * @return the amount of time between this year-week and the end year-week
     * @throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
