/**
 * An instantaneous point on the time-line measured in the UTC time-scale
 * with leap seconds.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The &lt;code&gt;java.time&lt;/code&gt; classes use the Java time-scale for simplicity.
 * That scale works on the assumption that the time-line is simple, there are no leap-seconds
 * and there are always 24 * 60 * 60 seconds in a day. Unfortunately, the Earth's rotation
 * is not straightforward, and a solar day does not match this definition.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class is an alternative representation based on the UTC time-scale which
 * includes leap-seconds. Leap-seconds are additional seconds that are inserted into the
 * year-month-day-hour-minute-second time-line in order to keep UTC in line with the solar day.
 * When a leap second occurs, an accurate clock will show the time {@code 23:59:60} just before midnight.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Leap-seconds are announced in advance, typically at least six months.
 * The {@link UtcRules} class models which dates have leap-seconds.
 * All the methods on this class use the latest available system rules.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The system leap-second rules fix the start point of UTC as 1972.
 * This date was chosen as UTC was more complex before 1972.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The duration between two points on the UTC time-scale is calculated solely using this class.
 * Do not use the {@code between} method on {@code Duration} as that will lose information.
 * Instead use {@link #durationUntil(UtcInstant)} on this class.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * It is intended that most applications will use the {@code Instant} class
 * which uses the UTC-SLS mapping from UTC to guarantee 86400 seconds per day.
 * Specialist applications with access to an accurate time-source may find this class useful.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Time-scale&lt;/h3&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The length of the solar day is the standard way that humans measure time.
 * As the Earth's rotation changes, the length of the day varies.
 * In general, a solar day is slightly longer than 86400 SI seconds.
 * The actual length is not predictable and can only be determined by measurement.
 * The UT1 time-scale captures these measurements.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional fractions
 * of a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as &lt;i&gt;leap-seconds&lt;/i&gt;.
 * A leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational changes.
 * If it is removed, then the relevant date will have no time of {@code 23:59:59}.
 * If it is added, then the relevant date will have an extra second of {@code 23:59:60}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing the concept of whole leap-seconds.
 * Between 1958 and 1972, the definition of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and
 * alterations to the length of the notional second.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class may be used for instants in the far past and far future.
 * Since some instants will be prior to 1972, it is not strictly an implementation of UTC.
 * Instead, it is a proleptic time-scale based on TAI and equivalent to it since 1972.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Implementation Requirements:&lt;/h3&gt;
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class must be treated as a value type. Do not synchronize, rely on the
 * identity hash code or use the distinction between equals() and ==.
