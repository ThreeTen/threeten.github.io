/**
 * Builder to create Accounting calendars.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Accounting calendars require setup before use, given how they are used.
 * The following information is required:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;ending day-of-week - The day-of-week on which a given accounting year ends.
 * &lt;li&gt;last-in-month vs. nearest-end-of-month - Whether the ending day-of-week is the last in the month,
 * or the nearest to the end of the month (will sometimes be in the &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt; month.
 * &lt;li&gt;month end - Which Gregorian/ISO end-of-month the year ends in/is nearest to.
 * &lt;li&gt;year division - How many 'months' (periods) to divide the accounting year into, 
 * and how many weeks are in each.
 * &lt;li&gt;leap-week month - Which month will have the leap 'week' added to it.  
 * In practice this is probably the last one, but this does not seem to be required.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are approximately 7 x 2 x 12 x 4 x 12/13 = 4032 combinations.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Implementation Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
 * This class is a mutable builder suitable for use from a single thread.
